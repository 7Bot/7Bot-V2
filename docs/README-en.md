## Usage
The simple and easy-to-use approach of the 7Bot robotic arm, with flexible and diverse scenario setups, is very suitable for popularizing artificial intelligence and robotics. It allows primary and secondary school students to easily operate, use, and experience the many joys of robotics and artificial intelligence applications without needing to understand complex and profound theoretical knowledge, thereby increasing interest in STEM subjects and inspiring students' innovative thinking abilities. Currently supported usage methods include:

1. Function buttons: Built-in button operation functions, through the use of function buttons on the device base, you can easily complete robotic arm motion teaching and motion control arrangement;

2. Graphical programming: 7Bot combines with Blockly to support graphical programming, allowing development and customization of flexible robotic arm application scenarios through a graphical interface;

3. 3D visualization software: Using the accompanying 3D visualization software, you can intuitively set various parameters of the robotic arm, visually see the robot's motion trajectory, robot status, robot control commands, etc. through digital twin effects, and use software functions to implement complex robotic arm tasks;

4. Programming development: Supports multiple communication methods, comes with Python language programming learning, Jupyter Notebook experimental cases, as well as course teaching experiments on various application topics such as motion planning, computer vision, and deep learning.
